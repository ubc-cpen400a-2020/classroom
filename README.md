## Q & A

If you have any questions regarding the assignments, please [post them on Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/kecc4tzxnau2o3). Unless your question contains personal information, it will be made public for the benefit of your classmates. For each assignment, we will have a different TA serving as a main point of contact, from whom you can expect to receive an answer (other TAs can chime in too, of course).
